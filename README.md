http://www.kolkatabizbook.com/ Learn How to Make Money Online When the internet and digital era dawned on planet earth it was for a select few. The necessary equipment like computers or the software needed to be connected online was very costly and only the top companies were able to fund the luxury of being online. In just a few years the scenario has totally flipped over as we now come to terms with the fact that digital lifestyle is the new way of life. With online connection progressing from stationary desktops to all kinds of mobile devices and the cost of having an internet connection that is fast and reliable continuously becoming more competitive, there can be no denying that the new world is that of artificial intelligence.  In my time of writing this I am made aware through a Neilsen survey that all mobile device users spend 30% of their time on social media. Now consider the proven research from IBISWorld that the top "trending" industries are all online and marking some incredible growth rate.
